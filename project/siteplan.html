            <p>Name: Kaluku Musics</p>
            <p>Reason: This name represents a music school/ organization that is dedicated to their customers and their need, that is reliable and ready to share of Jesus Christ.</p>
            <p>Site Purpose: This site was created as a need for an accessible and reliable service. This website will seek to bring information about a music school and how people can get around to apply for the music school. It will showcase the many programs offered by the school, a sign up form as well as a directory. It would come in handy as people could now access music lessons from professionals online.</p>
